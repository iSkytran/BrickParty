### Idea 
Our app is an app for planning fun activities for college students to share events on NC States campus.

## Future Functions
* Simplifies scheduling by giving student clubs and organizations a platform to post events
* When a user registers for an event, they have the option to sync the event with their Google Calendar
* The user will also get a reminder email the day before the event
*
